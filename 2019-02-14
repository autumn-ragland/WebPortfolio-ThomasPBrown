Morning:
Added detail side to projects page that fades in and out with javascript/css.
(alot) (kept javascript as short and sweet as possible)
minor spell checking(probably needs more.)
links now lead to other page(gmail only works in firefox, need to work it for chrome.)
reworked order of buttons to be static.
Change text color of each page to be easier to see.
