    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>
        I have lived in Memphis TN most of my life. I have been into video games from a young age and seek to pursue a career in game Development.
        After graduating from high-school, I attempted to continue my education in college at southwest Community College.
        With my attempt I figured out that College wasn't for me and stopped my pursuit for a degree.
    </p>
    <p>
        I took a break from college after a semester to try and learn a family trade with my family owned business.
        After working at the business for two year my I was informed about CodeCrew and followed up in trying out coding again.
        I discovered I really enjoyed it and continued with the program to hopefully gain a position one day in game development that I can be satisfied with.
